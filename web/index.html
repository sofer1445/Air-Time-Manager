    If you are serving your web app in a path other than the root, change the
    href value below to reflect the base path you are serving from.

    The path provided below has to start and end with a slash "/" in order for
    it to work correctly.

    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base

    This is a placeholder for base href that will be replaced by the value of
    the `--base-href` argument provided to `flutter build`.

  <!--
    In some port-forwarded/dev environments, the Flutter tool does not replace
    $FLUTTER_BASE_HREF when serving via the web-server device. That breaks
    relative asset URLs (e.g. flutter_bootstrap.js) and results in a blank page.
    For the MVP, we serve from the root, so keep this as "/".

    NOTE (dev): In Codespaces / port-forwarded environments a private port can
    redirect manifest.json requests to a GitHub sign-in endpoint, which then
    fails with CORS in the browser console. The manifest is not required for
    running the MVP in debug, so we keep it disabled.
    Re-enable when hosting publicly / for PWA installability.
